# ADR 5: Containerization and Horizontal Scaling

## Context

- Need to make the system horizontally scalable for enterprise-level performance
- Must simplify deployment with single commands for both development and production
- Need to standardize on Bun as the package manager for better performance
- Must support hot reloading in development mode for efficient developer experience
- Need to ensure the system can handle increased load through horizontal scaling

## Decision

Implement Docker-based containerization with horizontal scaling capabilities:

1. **Docker Compose for Environment Management**:
   - Development environment with hot reloading (`docker-compose.dev.yml`)
   - Production environment with optimized builds (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)
   - Single-command startup and shutdown via convenience scripts

2. **Bun as Standard Package Manager**:
   - Replace npm with Bun for all package management
   - Leverage Bun's performance benefits for faster builds and development

3. **Horizontal Scaling Configuration**:
   - Configure services for replication in production mode
   - Use environment variables to control scaling factors
   - Implement health checks for robust container orchestration

4. **Multi-Stage Builds for Production**:
   - Optimize container size and performance with multi-stage builds
   - Separate build and runtime environments for security and efficiency

## Rationale

- **Docker Compose**:
  - Provides consistent environments across development and production
  - Enables single-command orchestration of all services
  - Simplifies onboarding for new developers

- **Bun Package Manager**:
  - Offers significantly faster installation and build times
  - Provides better TypeScript integration
  - Reduces resource consumption during development

- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Essential for enterprise-level performance and reliability
  - Demonstrates understanding of cloud-native architecture principles
  - Creates opportunities to showcase load balancing and resilience

- **Multi-Stage Builds**:
  - Reduces attack surface in production containers
  - Minimizes container size for faster deployments
  - Industry best practice for container security

## Consequences

### Positive
- Single-command startup and shutdown simplifies operations
- Development environment with hot reloading improves developer productivity
- Horizontal scaling improves system resilience and performance
- Standardizing on Bun improves build and development performance
- Clear separation between development and production environments

### Negative
- Increased complexity in configuration files
- Requires Docker knowledge for development
- Local resource requirements may be higher due to containerization
