# ADR 3: Authentication System

## Context

- Need to demonstrate secure enterprise authentication
- Must be simple enough to implement quickly
- Should align with industry best practices
- Must support role-based access control (RBAC)
- Limited development time requires focusing on high-impact components

## Decision

Implement JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: For managing permissions
- **Refresh Token Rotation**: For enhanced security
- **Guard-based authorization**: Leveraging NestJS guards

## Rationale

- **JWT**:
  - Industry standard for modern web applications
  - Stateless design aligns with cloud-native principles
  - Easy to implement in the NestJS framework
  - Demonstrates security knowledge important for directory services

- **RBAC**:
  - Essential feature for enterprise directory services
  - Shows understanding of authorization patterns
  - Allows demonstration of complex permissions scenarios
  - Aligns with Microsoft's directory service requirements

- **NestJS Guards**:
  - Provides clean implementation of authorization logic
  - Demonstrates understanding of framework best practices
  - Enables separation of concerns

## Consequences

### Positive
- Demonstrates security best practices
- Quick to implement in chosen stack
- Shows awareness of enterprise authorization patterns
- Creates opportunity to discuss security in interviews

### Negative
- Not as comprehensive as enterprise SSO solutions
- Simpler than what might be used in an actual mega-scale directory service
- Limited federation capabilities
