/**
 * CloudSync Directory Service - Benchmark Tool
 * 
 * This script is used to measure the performance of various operations
 * in the CloudSync Directory Service.
 */

// This is a placeholder script - it will be fully implemented later
// after the API is developed. Below is a design outline:

/**
 * Benchmarks to be implemented:
 * 
 * 1. User Operations Throughput
 *    - Create, read, update, delete operations
 *    - Measure operations per second
 *    - Test with varying user counts
 * 
 * 2. Cache Performance
 *    - Measure response times with and without cache
 *    - Calculate cache hit ratios
 *    - Benchmark different caching strategies
 * 
 * 3. Concurrent User Simulation
 *    - Simulate multiple users accessing the system
 *    - Measure system stability under load
 *    - Track resource utilization
 * 
 * 4. Region Synchronization
 *    - Measure data sync times between simulated regions
 *    - Test conflict resolution strategies
 *    - Calculate data consistency metrics

console.log('Expected benchmarks to be implemented:');
console.log('1. User operations throughput');
console.log('2. Cache performance');
console.log('3. Concurrent user simulation');
console.log('4. Region synchronization');

// In the future, this script will include actual benchmarking code using:
// - axios for HTTP requests
// - node-worker-threads for concurrency
// - various metrics collection and reporting functions
